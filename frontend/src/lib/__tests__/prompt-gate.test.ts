/**
 * A gated prompt field is only READ while its discriminator selects it. Typing
 * into such a field therefore has to flip the discriminator too, or the value
 * is stored and silently ignored — which is exactly what happened to
 * text-to-speech: the modal wrote `directText`, `textSource` stayed at its
 * `"connected"` default, and the run failed with "no text found" while the
 * text sat there in the node (founder hit it live, 2026-08-14).
 *
 * These tests pin the contract from both ends: the declaration exists, and the
 * resolver actually honours the value the writers produce.
