/**
 * INVARIANT: as a SOURCE, `video-audit` is indistinguishable from
 * `video-analysis`.
 *
 * The audit re-emits the CORRECTED analysis — same canonical payload, same
 * field (`generatedJson`), same `json` + `text` handle pair. So every set that
 * decides "may this source feed that input?" must classify the two identically,
 * or a downstream node can tell an audited analysis from a raw one: the canvas
 * validator rejects an edge the orchestrator would happily route, or a typed
 * pip's popover lists zero candidates ("cannot connect the outputs" bug class).
 *
 * Written as a PARITY sweep rather than a hand-listed set of memberships (the
 * voice-changer-pro twin test in packages/shared/src/__tests__/producer-types.
 * test.ts is the precedent): every exported producer/source Set in these
 * modules is discovered at runtime, so a set added LATER is covered without
 * anyone remembering this file. A deliberate asymmetry has to be argued for
 * here — it can't be introduced silently.
