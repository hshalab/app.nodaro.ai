/**
 * A scrollable pane inside a React Flow node MUST carry `nowheel`, or it does not
 * scroll at all.
 *
 * React Flow's `panOnScroll` handler (enabled on our canvas) calls
 * `preventDefault()` + `stopImmediatePropagation()` on every wheel event that is
 * not inside a `.nowheel` subtree, so the canvas pans and the overflow container
 * never receives the event. The failure is silent and easy to misread as "the
 * preview is just short": the video-analysis result tree shipped without it and
 * scrolled only in the expanded modal, which is portaled outside the canvas.
 *
 * Pinned as source text rather than a render assertion because the bug is a missing
 * CLASS NAME — a rendering test would need a real React Flow provider and wheel
 * plumbing to catch what one grep proves.
 *
 * Covers EVERY node that renders an analysis tree inline, not just the first one
 * that hit the bug: video-audit is a second copy of the same pane (it renders the
 * corrected analysis through the same JsonTree), so it is the same trap.
