// node got it for free. Moving it into the run strip trades that for a seam
// that can drift: a pill that frames its own toolbar could render a Run button
// without one, and nothing would fail — the control would just be missing from
// that node type, which is exactly how the "cannot connect the outputs" class of
// bug happens in this repo.
//
// The invariant that makes it safe: the settings button is rendered by
// RunNodeButton, and every pill renders RunNodeButton. These tests check both
// halves from source, so a new bespoke toolbar cannot quietly opt out.
