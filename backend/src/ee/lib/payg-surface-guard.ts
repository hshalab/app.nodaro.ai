 * Spend-surface enforcement (decision log D1, 2026-08-12).
 *
 * The web studio and every other first-party consumer surface (studio /
 * person / voice / recast / recut / stitch SPAs, the browser extension) are
 * subscription products. Credits held WITHOUT an active subscription — the
 * derived "payg" tier — are a developer product, redeemable through the
 * programmatic surfaces only (API, SDK, CLI, MCP), "like ElevenLabs".
 *
 * This is a product boundary, not a security boundary: a user scripting raw
 * HTTP against us with their own JWT presents no Origin, derives as `api`,
 * and passes — at that point they ARE using the API. What the block targets
 * is the logged-in browser session inside our own products.
 *
 * Buying credits stays open everywhere by construction: the billing routes
 * (create-load-session, auto-recharge settings) never call this guard.

 * credit-guard impl and the run-route preHandlers), and route suites
 * routinely vi.mock `lib/config.js` with partial factories (`hasCredits`
 * only). A `config` binding here turns every such suite into opaque 500s.
 * Strict parse mirrors the schema entries in config.ts, which remain the
 * documented ops surface; both default OFF.
